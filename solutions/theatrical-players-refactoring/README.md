# Refactoring

This kata is based on Refactoring book. It mimics the code used and might be used to follow up the reading.

## Refactoring moves

In this file I will keep track of the refactorings used to reach the final solution for the kata. I am using vscode
and webstorm and comparing the autoated refactorings that each one of them offers.

> Note: vscode used out-of-the-box, no extensions used

| Refactoring | Vscode | Webstorm |

| Change function declaration | ❌ (with abracadabra ✅ cmd + .)  | ✅ cmd + f6 |
